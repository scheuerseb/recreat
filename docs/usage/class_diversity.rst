Class diversity
===============

Class diversity corresponds to the distinct, unique land-use classes (opportunity types) 
relevant for recreation within a given cost threshold.

    Outputs are written into the INDICATORS folder.

Depending on whether recreat is used from the CLI through recreat_util, or in a script, 
class diversity is determined as follows.
