# ReCreat - Indicators on Landscape Recreational Potential

The intention of this toolbox is to create, i.e., derive indicators on landscape recreational potential. The elaborated indicators shall characterise and assess recreational opportunities at landscape level, based on a minimum set of gridded input data. At the least, a land-use raster is required. Ooptionally, for certain aspects of analysis, a gridded populationdataset  is needed.
